# GoalTracker
Personal project for tracking goals using JavaFx.

This tracks daily goals and longterm goals, assigning point values to each task. Points accumulate and can be used to purchase rewards, such as ice cream or new shoes. 

I created this project for personal use and to learn how to use 1) JavaFx and 2) Excel files with Java.
